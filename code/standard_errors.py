"""Under appropriate conditions (e.g iid observations), the asymptotic covariance
   matrix of the maximum likelihood estimator is equal to the inverse of the 
   information matrix.
       
   The hessian covariance matrix method:
       - is based upon the hessian matrix, the matrix of second derivatives
       - typically has somewhat better properties for use in estimation for small 
       samples
       
   The jacobian matrix method:
       - is based upon the Jacobian matrix, the matrix of first derivatives
       - requires the individual likelihood contributions
       
In general the hessian and jacobian matrices will not have identical covariance matrices

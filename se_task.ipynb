    "We want to calculate standard errors for parameter estimates of likelihood models. More specifically, we want the full covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. There are different ways to calculate those covariance matrices, but in all cases they are based on some kind of derivative of the log likelihood function (loglike) or the log likelihood function per observation (loglikeobs). \n",
